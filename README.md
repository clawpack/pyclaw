# PyClaw

Pyclaw is a Python-based solver for hyperbolic PDEs that includes the algorithms
of Clawpack and SharpClaw.  
It has been designed with easy extensibility, performance, and exploration in mind.
PyClaw also includes a scalable parallel implementation of Clawpack using PETSc.

You can get the latest development version of PyClaw from
