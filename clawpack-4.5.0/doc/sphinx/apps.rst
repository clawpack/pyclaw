Starting with Clawpack 4.4,
a number of applications are now included in the main Clawpack 
distribution, in the directory `$CLAW/apps <claw/apps>`_.
Some of these have been adapted from 
`Clawpack 4.3 applications <http://www.amath.washington.edu/~claw/apps.html>`_  
Converting other applications from there
and building up a better collection of other
examples is ongoing work.

You can browse through the examples from the galleries below:

 * `One-dimensional applications <claw/doc/gallery/gallery_1d.html>`_
 * `Two-dimensional applications <claw/doc/gallery/gallery_2d.html>`_
 * `GeoClaw applications <claw/doc/gallery/gallery_geoclaw.html>`_
 * `All applications <claw/doc/gallery/gallery_all.html>`_
