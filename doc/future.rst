Future work
********************


PyClaw and PetClaw should be considered beta software at present.  Major changes are
being made to the user interface and internal structure.  A first release is expected
at the end of 2011.

Some major future plans include 

    * Adaptive mesh refinement
    * Additional solver algorithms (possibly FD WENO and DG)
    * Improved plotting, including incorporation with Visit or some other package
