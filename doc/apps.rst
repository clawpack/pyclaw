========================================
The built-in PyClaw application scripts
========================================
PyClaw comes with many example application scripts in the directory `pyclaw/apps/`.
These applications are meant to demonstrate the kinds of things that can be done
with PyClaw and are a great place to learn how to use PyClaw.  To run one of them
simply do the following at the command prompt::

    $ cd $PYCLAW/apps/acoustics/1d/homogeneous
    $ make
    $ python acoustics.py

You can run any of the apps similarly by going to the appropriate directory,
running `make` to compile the necessary Fortran code, and executing the Python
script.

Command-line options
========================================
For convenience, the scripts are set up to accept certain command-line options.
These usually include the following:

   * use_petsc: set to 1 to run in parallel

   * solver_type: set to classic or sharpclaw

   * iplot: set to 1 to automatically launch interactive plotting after running.
     Note that this shouldn't be used in parallel, as every process will try to plot.

   * htmlplot: set to 1 to automatically creat HTML plot pages after running.

   * outdir: the name of the subdirectory in which to put output files.  Defaults to
     './_output'.

This list of options could easily be extended by modifying the appropriat script.

Adding new applications
========================================
If you have used PyClaw, we'd love to add your application to the built-in scripts.
